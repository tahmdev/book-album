# Stuff I learned: 

- How to use React Router 
- How to interact with Databases (Get, Post, Update, Delete)
- About the existence of Refs and how to use them to hide a popup on click outside
- Gained experience with CSS Grid 

# Stuff I learned (by doing wrong)

- Importance of clean code 
  - Comments
  - Splitting code into more components, rather than having a single huge component
  - Splitting components into multiple files 
  - Splitting CSS into multiple files, rather than having one 1000 line long css file
  - Using class names to style rather than IDs 
- Learned about the existence of hooks (too late to make much use of them in this project) 
- Another reason for Mobile First: It's easier to design for a small screen and then adjust for a large screen than design for a large screen and making the content fit on a smaller device
